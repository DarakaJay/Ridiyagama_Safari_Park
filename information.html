        <h4>Hippopotamus</h4>
        <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Hippopotamus amphibius</p>
        <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Found in rivers, lakes, and wetlands across sub-Saharan Africa, typically in areas with abundant water to support their semi-aquatic lifestyle</p>
        <p><strong>Diet:</strong> Herbivorous, primarily grazes on short grasses and occasionally consumes aquatic vegetation, eating about 80 pounds (36 kg) of grass per night</p>
        <p><strong>Size:</strong> 10.8-16.5 feet (3.3-5 meters) length and 4.5-5.5 feet (1.4-1.65 meters) at the shoulder in height, Males can weigh 3,500-9,920 pounds (1,600-4,500 kg) and females typically weigh 2,900-3,300 pounds (1,300-1,500 kg) </p>
        <p><strong>Social Structure:</strong> Live in groups called pods, schools, or bloats, consisting of 10-30 individuals, led by a dominant male</p>
        <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Hippopotamuses are semi-aquatic and spend most of their time in water to keep cool. They are highly territorial in water but less so on land. Despite their bulky appearance, they can run up to 19 miles per hour (30 km/h) on land over short distances</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Vulnerable, primarily due to habitat loss, poaching for meat and ivory (from their teeth), and human-wildlife conflicts</p>
        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Typically 40-50 years in the wild, in captivity they can live slightly longer with proper care</p>

        <p><strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Least Concern, due to their wide distribution and adaptability, but populations are managed in many regions to prevent overpopulation and human-wildlife conflicts</p>
        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Typically 10-14 years in the wild, although many do not survive past 4-5 years due to hunting and predation</p>
